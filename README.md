# SolidityLearningJourney

This repository contains my first smart contracts developed during the Chainlink Bootcamp. It showcases my progress and learning journey in Solidity, the programming language for smart contracts. The contracts included are:

1. Token.sol: A simple ERC20 token contract named "Renft721" (RFT). It extends the ERC20Mintable contract from OpenZeppelin.

2. RegisterAccess.sol: A contract that allows storing and accessing information in a string array. It includes an owner who can add members to a whitelist for access control.

3. DNFTBootcamp.sol: An ERC721 token contract named "dNFTBootcamp" (DBTC). It allows minting and managing unique NFTs representing characters with associated metadata.

4. NftRunners.sol: An ERC721 token contract named "RunnerNFT" (RUN). It mints dNFTs representing characters with a distance attribute. It includes randomness number generation using Chainlink VRF.

5. NameContract.sol: A contract that stores and retrieves a name string. It demonstrates the basics of contract deployment and state storage.

6. Counter.sol: A contract that implements a counter. It showcases the usage of the AutomationCompatibleInterface for scheduling automated upkeep tasks.

These contracts serve as milestones in my journey to learn and master Solidity. Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress as I continue to develop more advanced smart contracts. Any feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
